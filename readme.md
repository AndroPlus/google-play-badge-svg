google-play-badge-svg
=====================

Hosting for localized versions of Google Play badges in SVG format.

## About

It's possible to use Apple's linkmaker service to generate localized "Download on the App Store" SVG badges for your application. However, no similar service exists for Google's "Get it on Google Play" badges.

This repository serves mostly as hosting for Google's badges in SVG format.

## Usage

Simply link to the badge you require like so:

````
<img src="http://steverichey.github.io/google-play-badge-svg/en_get.svg">
````

This is still a work in progress! More information will be forthcoming.
